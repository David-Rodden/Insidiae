# Insidiae
### Summary
Insidiae is being developed as a game in which players can utilize their strategic capabilities.
A plot of land is allotted to the user with which resources and forces, both economical and physical, must be leveraged to propagate the user's empire.
The game ends only when a user has been vanquished as opposing forces strengthen throughout.
Points are used as a measure of overall game success and are based on exchanges, acquisitions, and decisions with neighboring states.

### Territory
Initial territory is given to a user randomly based on specific traits selected at the beginning of the game.
These traits are as follows:
* Potable water
* Fertile land
* Stable climate
* Unlikeliness of natural disasters
* Fauna prevalence

Traits have 5 slots each, and a new player is given 12 to distribute among them.

Upon creating a game instance, the traits will be taken into consideration to find land suitable to these conditions.
From there on, land is acquired through trade deals and conquering of neighboring territories.
Both could bode either well or poorly for the player in the future.

With more territory comes a greater deal of management.
Although owned by one user, if a territory's span becomes quite large, one must take into consideration the differing biomes and communities.
Administration of one particular piece of a territory that is in need of wood to survive the winter is quite different than the administration of a piece of territory that requires weapons after a daunting altercation with the tribe next door.
